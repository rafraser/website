# Personal Website

## ðŸš§ Under Construction

I'm currently working on some better systems to build & deploy everything together to a nice website.

(Update 2023: yeah look turns out I like making projects more than I like sticking things together. I'm currently looking at using [Astro](https://astro.build/) to build a nice website together, but it'll still be a little while.)

At the moment, all of these projects are standalone projects. Check the README in each folder for more details!
